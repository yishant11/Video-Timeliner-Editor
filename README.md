## Features

- **Video Upload & Playback**: Upload video files or use sample content
- **Interactive Timeline**: Click-to-seek timeline with time markers every 10 seconds
- **Key Moments Navigation**: Auto-generated key moments with importance ratings
- **Visual Segments**: Silent and highlighted segments displayed on timeline
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with touch support
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **HTML5 Video API** for media control

## Architecture Overview

### Component Structure

### Key Design Decisions

1. **State Management**: Used React's built-in state management with hooks for simplicity and performance
2. **Timeline Implementation**: HTML/CSS-based timeline for better performance than Canvas/D3.js
3. **Video Control**: Direct HTML5 video element manipulation for precise timing control
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interactions

### Performance Optimizations

- **useCallback** hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useMemo** for expensive calculations (time markers)
- **Object URL cleanup** to prevent memory leaks
- **Efficient event handling** with event delegation

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone <video-timeline>
cd video-timeline
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Start the development server:
\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

1. **Upload Video**: Drag and drop a video file or click "Choose File"
2. **Use Sample**: Click "Load Sample Video" for demo content
3. **Navigate Timeline**: Click anywhere on the timeline to seek
4. **Jump to Moments**: Click key moments in the sidebar to jump to timestamps
5. **Visual Indicators**: 
   - Red segments = Silent periods
   - Yellow segments = Highlighted content
   - Green markers = Key moments

## Development Notes

### Trade-offs Made

1. **HTML/CSS vs Canvas**: Chose HTML/CSS for timeline to maintain accessibility and reduce complexity
2. **Mock Data**: Used static mock data instead of real AI analysis for demo purposes
3. **File Storage**: Used object URLs instead of cloud storage for simplicity
4. **State Management**: Used React hooks instead of Redux for reduced complexity

### Challenges Faced

1. **Timeline Precision**: Ensuring accurate click-to-seek calculations across different screen sizes
2. **Mobile Touch**: Implementing smooth touch interactions without interfering with video controls
3. **Performance**: Optimizing re-renders during video playback
4. **Responsive Design**: Balancing information density with mobile usability

### Testing Recommendations

- Test with various video formats and sizes
- Verify touch interactions on mobile devices
- Check accessibility with screen readers
- Test performance with long videos
- Validate responsive behavior across breakpoints
